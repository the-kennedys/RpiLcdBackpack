RpiLcdBackpack
==============

Python code for driving the Adafruit LCD Backpack
Code much influenced and copied from the Adafruit libraries for Arduino:
See https://github.com/adafruit/LiquidCrystal and
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/tree/master/Adafruit_CharLCD


This is using an MCP23008 IO expander to drive the pins on an HD44780 LCD driver

I modified the code to work with 20x4 LCD displays.
